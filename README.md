# [Handwriting-Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
## Project Description:
For this project I looked at the data containing different hand writings of numbers with the pixel numbers of the images. I built some classification models for predictions, and compare the model performance.
## Data preparation: 
I first convert label column to factor. Second, I split the data into training and validation data frames. Third, I look at the summary for part of the training data frame. I found out that there are some pixels taking on value of 0 for all data points. Last, I just remove all those pixels.
